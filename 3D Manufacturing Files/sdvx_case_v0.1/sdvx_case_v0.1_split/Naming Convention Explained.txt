The PCB part of the case has the origin in the top left


(0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 0)
(0, 1) (1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 1)
(0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 2)

The encoder parts go as follows:

enc_L, enc_L_side			     enc_R_side,  enc_R
enc_L_lower(0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 0)enc_R_lower
	   (0, 1) (1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 1)
	   (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 2)
